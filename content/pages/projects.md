Examples of Course Projects
---------------------------

Each graduate student taking this class for credit should decide on a term-project. We ask for a 10-page written report (maximum length), and a 20 minute oral presentation to the class before the end of term. Undergraduates do not have to give an oral report (but may, if they wish) and a six-page paper is acceptable. Projects can expand on something covered in class, or be some climate-relevant project not touched upon. In the past, most such projects have been reviews of some interesting topics. A few students have succeeded in doing an original piece of work, but this is certainly not a requirement.

Previous topics include:

*   Orography, tectonic uplift, and climate
*   The history and implications of Dansgaard-Oeschger events
*   The closure of the Panama Gateway and its effect on climate
*   A box model approach to the coupled system
*   Ocean abyssal circulation and mixing: a historical development
*   Source contributions to fine aerosol mass as determined from receptor modeling
*   The Indian summer monsoon and the effects of the Tibetan Plateau
*   Possible microphysical impacts of aerosols on the climate of the last glacial maximum
*   Energy balance model for long term climate study
*   Predicting regional climate change
*   The evolution of climate on venus and its relation to earth
*   Investigating thermohaline circulation rearrangements with a simple climate box model
*   The North Atlantic oscillation and dependence upon atmospheric sensitivity to SST anomalies
*   Sub-Saharan drought
*   Climate change and its influence on babylonian civilization

Other Possibilities (Not Intended to Restrict Your Choice)

*   Is ethanol an energy source or sink?
